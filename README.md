## Description

The thought behind creating this was to have code that I can re-use to develop more complex applications. I was revising Java programming and wanted to have all the individual parts of Java accessible to me. Hence, I started saving the codes and documenting them. These codes can now be used to understand the syntax or concepts, mainly one can reuse this as a base to develop almost any kind of Java application. Each file from file no 3 has a ReadMe that has the description of every project in it. Pls read this if you have any doubts and for a little theory.

These files have all Java modules and should be referred to as a guide or example, I do not recommend learning from these. They are quite thorough but not as much as they should be to learn Java. I hope to update this and have more theory and better coding practices included. During my studies, I was referring to a Udemy course and various online sites for help. I would also recommend looking at the official document for any lib you use as this habit will come in very handy and the official documents will inform you of many new methods that were previously unknown to you.

## Prerequisites

I have used the IntelliJ IDEA for all my coding. With this, the Java version I am using is 11. I would recommend using anything above v8, below this many of the programs will not run.

- JavaFX

   For JavaFX, you will need to install and include external libraries. If the Main.java is having errors then this is most probably your problem.

- Databases
 
   I a using SQLite3 for database manipulation projects. Pls, view the file ReadME for the installation procedure.
